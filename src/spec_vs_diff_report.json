However, due to truncation, the diff summary does not provide sufficient evidence that all required sections (grid, detailed bullets/steps, final CTA) and the required navigation CTAs to \"/partner-onboarding\" and \"/contact\" are actually present/linked as specified across the full page.",

      "reason": "The diff shows a new SEO block and the start of a hero section plus data arrays for card-like sections, but the file is truncated before demonstrating the required multi-card/grid section, detailed bullets/steps section, and final CTA section, as well as confirmation that all placeholder content is removed.",
