# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the `/page-3` placeholder with a production-ready Page 3 layout that matches the visual quality and section structure of Page 2, including updated SEO and clear navigation CTAs.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign `/page-3` to remove placeholder content and add a full layout: hero section, multi-card/grid section, detailed content section (bullets/steps), and a final CTA section.
- Ensure Page 3 styling is cohesive with existing site patterns (Tailwind + shadcn/ui composition) and responsive across mobile/tablet/desktop.
- Update Page 3 SEO metadata (English title + description) while keeping canonical URL as `/page-3`.
- Add prominent CTA links/buttons routing to existing flows: `/partner-onboarding` and `/contact`, using the same Link/Button patterns as Page 2.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting `/page-3` shows a complete, responsive marketing-style page with clear sections and CTA buttons that navigate to partner onboarding and contact.
